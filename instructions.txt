We are going to construct an imagen4 access point using this model of code that google gave us: 

from google import genai

# TODO(developer): Update and un-comment below lines
# project_id = "PROJECT_ID"
client = genai.Client(vertexai=True, project=project_id, location="us-central1")

prompt = """
A white wall with two Art Deco travel posters mounted. First poster has the text: "NEPTUNE", tagline: "The jewel of the solar system!' Second poster has the text: "JUPITER", tagline: "Travel with the giants!
"""

image = client.models.generate_images(
   model="imagen-4.0-generate-preview-05-20",
   prompt=prompt,
)

# OPTIONAL: View the generated image in a notebook
# image.generated_images[0].image.show()


Want we want to do with this is to create in python a script that will handle promps from a terminal, pass the prompt to the imagen4 model, and return the image to the terminal.
